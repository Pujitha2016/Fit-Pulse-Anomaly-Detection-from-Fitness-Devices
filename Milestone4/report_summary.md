Milestone-4 Report Summary

This milestone focuses on developing a Streamlit-based Health Anomaly Detection Dashboard 
that enables users to upload their fitness data, process it through analytical pipelines, 
visualize health metrics, and download anomaly reports for further evaluation.

Key Functionalities
1.File Upload (CSV/JSON): Users can import datasets directly into the dashboard for analysis.
2.Integrated Pipeline: With a single action, the system performs:
3.Data preprocessing
4.Feature engineering
5.Basic modeling
6.Anomaly detection across multiple metrics
Interactive Visual Insights: Visualizations generated using Plotly include:
Heart Rate Trends with anomaly markers
Sleep Duration highlighting abnormal patterns
Step Count Behavior with low activity alerts

Filtering & User Controls: Date range selection allows focused inspection of specific time periods.
Automated Reporting: Anomaly results are summarized in a table and exported as a CSV report, useful for documentation and analysis

Tools & Technologies
Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, JSON, Google Colab, pyngrok

Outcome
Milestone-4 successfully integrates previous components into a unified dashboard that is user-friendly,
interactive, and capable of detecting anomalies in health data with simple reporting features.
