Milestone-4 Report Summary

This milestone focuses on developing a Streamlit-based Health Anomaly Detection Dashboard 
that enables users to upload their fitness data, process it through analytical pipelines, 
visualize health metrics, and download anomaly reports for further evaluation.

Key Functionalities:
1.File Upload (CSV/JSON): Users can import datasets directly into the dashboard for analysis.

2.Integrated Pipeline: With a single action, the system performs:
-Data preprocessing.
-Feature engineering.
-Basic modeling.
-Anomaly detection across multiple metrics.

3.Interactive Visual Insights: Visualizations generated using Plotly include:
Heart Rate Trends with anomaly markers.
Sleep Duration highlighting abnormal patterns.
Step Count Behavior with low activity alerts.

4.Filtering & User Controls: Date range selection allows focused inspection of specific time periods.
5.Automated Reporting: Anomaly results are summarized in a table and exported as a CSV report, useful for documentation and analysis.

Tools & Technologies:
Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, JSON, Google Colab, pyngrok.

Outcome:
Milestone-4 successfully integrates previous components into a unified dashboard that is user-friendly,
interactive, and capable of detecting anomalies in health data with simple reporting features.
